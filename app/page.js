      <p><em>Natural assistance aligned with AU.</em></p>

      <p>
        Wancko is a natural assistant designed to support clarity, balance,
        and decision-making within complex contexts. It does not replace
        judgment, impose morality, or simulate authority.
      </p>

      <p>
        Operating within the AU framework, Wancko prioritizes coherence over
        optimization and understanding over control. It intervenes only where
        assistance is meaningful and refrains where autonomy must remain intact.
      </p>

      <p style={{ opacity: 0.7, marginTop: "32px" }}>
        Wancko does not provide therapy, moral judgment, or external authority.
        It operates in coordination with governance, value exchange, and
        certification systems within the AU ecosystem.
